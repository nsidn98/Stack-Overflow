# Code usage

Run `DDPG Class ver2 (Pendulum-v0) 2 states.ipynb` for the version with 2 dimensional state (`sin() and theta_dot`)

Run `DDPG Class ver2 (Pendulum-v0) 3 states.ipynb` for the version with 3 dimensional state (`sin(), cos() and theta_dot`)

Once the results are stored in `scores` list, copy them from the first `.ipynb` to the other and then plot the rewards graph.
